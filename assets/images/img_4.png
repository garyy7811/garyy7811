I cannot display the binary image content directly in text. The image files would need to be referenced by file path or base64 encoding. Would you like me to provide guidance on setting up the GitHub Pages static site with the text you've shared, or help prepare the markdown and configuration files?

For the GitHub Pages setup, I can help you create:
1. index.md (main content page)
2. README.md 
3. _config.yml (site configuration)
4. _layouts/default.html (page template)
5. assets/css/style.css (custom styling)

Would you like me to draft those files for you?
