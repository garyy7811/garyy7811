I apologize, but I cannot print the image file content directly as a text. Images are binary files and cannot be represented as pure text. If you want to see the actual image, you would need to view it directly or use an image viewer/editor.

However, I can help you create the GitHub Pages static website with the text you provided. Would you like me to help you structure the files and create the necessary markdown and configuration files for the GitHub Pages site?

For the structure, I recommend:
1. Create an `index.md` as the main page
2. Create a `_config.yml` for GitHub Pages configuration
3. Create a `_layouts/default.html` for page template
4. Add an `assets/css/style.css` for styling
5. Add images to `assets/images/`

Would you like me to generate those files with your provided text?
