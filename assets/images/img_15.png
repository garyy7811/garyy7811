I apologize, but I cannot print the image file contents as pure code. Images are binary files and cannot be represented as plain text code. 

If you want me to help you with the GitHub Pages website, I can assist you in structuring the files, creating markdown content, and setting up the configuration. Would you like me to help you create the specific files for the GitHub Pages site based on the text you provided?

For example, I can help you create:
- index.md with the main content
- README.md 
- _config.yml for Jekyll configuration
- A default layout HTML file
- CSS styling file

Would you like me to proceed with creating these files?
