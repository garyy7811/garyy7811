I apologize, but I cannot print the actual image data for /assets/images/img_1.png as it requires the actual binary image file content. For a GitHub Pages website, I can help you structure the files and provide markdown and configuration content. Would you like me to help you create the necessary files for the GitHub Pages site with the text you've provided?

For the website structure, I recommend:
- index.md as the main page
- README.md for GitHub repository description
- _config.yml for Jekyll configuration
- _layouts/default.html for page template
- assets/css/style.css for custom styling
- assets/images/ for storing diagrams and images

Would you like me to help you draft these files with the content you've shared?
