# AWS Implementation Architecture

## Overview of OnDemandEnv AWS Architecture

Our AWS implementation demonstrates the practical application of contract-first design and domain-driven principles across a sophisticated cloud infrastructure.

## Core AWS Service Components

### 1. AWS Organizations
- Multi-account strategy
- Centralized governance
- Isolated environment management

### 2. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Least privilege access control
- Cross-account role assumptions
- Fine-grained permission management

### 3. Service Contract Discovery Mechanism
- AWS SSM Parameter Store
- Centralized contract registry
- Dynamic service mapping

## Environment Management Infrastructure

### AWS Services Used
- AWS Organizations
- AWS Control Tower
- AWS Service Catalog
- AWS Systems Manager
- AWS EventBridge
- AWS CodeBuild
- AWS CodePipeline

## Networking Design

### Network Isolation Strategies
- Separate VPCs per environment
- VPC Peering
- AWS Transit Gateway
- Secure cross-account networking
- Private link configurations
