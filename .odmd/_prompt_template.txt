this is a github page website I'm working on, here's all the code

help me change the code so that it can be accessed from garyy7811.github.io




Pay attention here: list all unchanged, new, moved/renamed and deleted files/folders in yaml format strictly:

#Last line received: <last line you received>
#Total lines received: <how many lines of text you received in message>
#<lines for conversation/comments>
#...
#<lines for conversation/comments>
unchanged:
  - <path to file>
new:
  - <path to new file>,<file size in integer> #<short comment if needed>
moved:
  - <old path>,<new path>
deleted:
  - <path to deleted file> #<short comment if needed>
updated:
  - <path to file>,<file size in integer> #<short comment if needed>




PLEASE print NOTHING out of the yml, no word, no punctuation or symbol, not even ```yaml line!
WARNING: Failure to produce EXACTLY the specified YAML format with NO additional text will result in task rejection.
