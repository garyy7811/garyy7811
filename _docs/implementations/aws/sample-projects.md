# Sample AWS Implementation Projects

## Coffee Shop Order Management System

### Overview
A comprehensive example demonstrating complex service interactions and contract-driven design in a distributed AWS environment.

### Project Repositories
- [Order Manager Service](https://github.com/ondemandenv/coffee-shop--order-manager)
- [Order Processor Service](https://github.com/ondemandenv/coffee-shop--order-processor)

### Architecture Highlights
- Event-driven microservices
- AWS Lambda functions
- DynamoDB for persistent storage
- EventBridge for inter-service communication
- AWS Step Functions for workflow management

## Key Service Interactions

### Order Flow
1. Order received by Order Manager
2. Validated against contract specifications
3. Persisted in DynamoDB
4. Event published to EventBridge
5. Order Processor triggered
6. Complex processing workflow
7. Final order status update
